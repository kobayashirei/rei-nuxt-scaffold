# Registry Protocol Initialization

Date: 2025-12-05 18:00

## Actions

1.  **Created `docs/prompt.md`**:
    - Implemented "Networked Structure Registry Protocol (NSRP)".
    - Defined the "LAIU Loop" (Locate, Analyze, Implement, Update).
    - Enforced strong networking constraints (Dependencies/Dependents).

2.  **Initialized `docs/structure.md`**:
    - Converted previous structure map into a formal **Registry**.
    - Mapped existing `counter` store and `app.vue` with network links.

## Network Updates
- **Registry**: Established as the Source of Truth.
- **Counter Store**: Marked as used by `app.vue`.
